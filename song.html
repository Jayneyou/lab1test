            <p>I got your emails</p>
            <p>You just don't get females</p>
            <p>Now, do you?</p>
            <br>
            <p>What's in the heart</p>
            <p>Is not on your head</p>
            <p>Anywhere</p>
            <br>
            <p>Mate, you're too late</p>
            <p>And your weren't worth the wait</p>
            <p>Now, were you?</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's out of my hands</p>
            <p>Since you blew your last chance</p>
            <p>When you played me</p>
            <br>
            <p>You'll have to cry me out</p>
            <p>You'll have to cry me out</p>
            <p>The tears that I'll fall</p>
            <p>Mean nothing at all</p>
            <p>It's time to get over yourself</p>
            <br>
            <p>Baby, you ain't all that</p>
            <p>Maybe, there's no way back</p>
            <p>You can keep talking</p>
            <p>But, baby, I'm walking away</p>
